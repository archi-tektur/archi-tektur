### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, Iâ€™m __Oskar__ - experienced programmer, technology enthusiast and conference speaker. Despite my young age, my portfolio is full of interesting products and challenges - Iâ€™m known for bringing often a new, fresh perspective and energy to the team.

Iâ€™m not afraid of new challenges and continuous development - itâ€™s just the daily part of our job, isnâ€™t it? I get used to build up products using lean startup method and in data-driven environment - however Iâ€™m open to meet new standards and approaches.

On the private site Iâ€™m huge aviation enthusiast, Iâ€™m taking the course for private pilot licence PPL(A). Iâ€™m also interested into urban planning, architecture and city planning. Yet my favourite game is Cities Skylines. Iâ€™m also a typical cat person - having three sweet cuties.
